            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The customer review is important to improve
              service for company, which have both close opinion and open
              opinion. The open opinion means the comment as text which
              shows emotion and comment directly from customer. However,
              the company has many contents or group to evaluation
              themselves by rating and total rating for a type of services which
              there are many customer who needs to review. The problem is
              some customers given rating contrast with their comments. The
              other reviewers must read many comments and comprehensive
              the comments that are different from the rating. Therefore, this
              paper proposes the analysis and prediction rating from customer
              reviews who commented as open opinion using probability's
              classifier model. The classifier models are used case study of
              customer review's hotel in open comments for training data to
              classify comments as positive or negative called opinion mining.
              In addition, this classifier model has calculated probability that
              shows value of trend to give the rating using naive bayes
              techniques, which gives correctly classifier to 94.37Â°~ compared
              with decision tree Techniques.</p>

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>Nowadays, a company or organization provide a business
                  service which needs to get feedback from customer. With the
                  rapid expansion of company or organization have more
                  services and products online and enhance customer
                  satisfaction. The provider will read customer review and other
                  customers who need to use services or products will read
                  review to express opinions on the services. The number of
                  customer review is increasing or huge from website, blogs,
                  forums and social media, which the services or product is
                  interesting. Therefore, many customers will read comment
                  randomly which is hard to read all comments and make
                  decision the services or products. If customer reads a few
                  reviews, customer might get opinion review to be bias.
                  Therefore, opinion mining is a technique of field area of
                  information extraction from text processing, which is benefit
                  and many opportunities to improve or develop factor to
                  business work by this analysis. The problem is the comments
                  from customer review about products or services, which are
                  contrast with comments. For example, the customer commented "Even if I stay alone, it was safe, clean and suite
                  for seminar". However, the customer given rating only 5.7
                  which others customer expected more rating. Or the customer
                  commented "Old room, dirty, and water flow in toilet was very
                  slow. Breakfast was not delicious, services was not good",
                  customer given value rating 4.3, it seems to bias their
                  comments. Therefore, the opinion mining is computing value
                  automatically which can be trended to their opinion to judge
                  the comments negative and positive.
                  Many researches in sentiment analysis and opinion mining
                  have been many languages, for example, Chinese [1],[2],[3],
                  Arabic[4],[5], Vietnamese[6], and Thai[7]. These researches
                  focused into 2 ways: analysis of sentence has level of
                  sentiment from emotion word and calculated score ofsimilarity
                  or cluster with the kind of word as positive or negative called
                  sentiment polarity [7],[8],[9],[10]. Secondly, the papers
                  [11],[12],[13] proposed and survey the classifier model to
                  summarize sentence as positive and negative and try to apply
                  in other case studies [14], [15]. However, the summarized from
                  opinion sentences are unable to show the continuous value
                  trending to negative and positive. For example, sentiment
                  analysis summarizes as positive, however, the customer still
                  needs to know rating the overall value of positive opinion
                  indicating a number. Therefore, our approach will be proposed
                  methodology in this paper that can be generating from
                  probability of classifier models.</p>
